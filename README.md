# Makefile Interpreter ( Python )
Rather, a build variables Collector, does not perform Rules<br>
I want to use it as PlatformIO ( NuttX and others who use Maке ) plugin<br>
I also want to note that I am not a Python Pro, so don't shoot the pianist...<br>
To note the fact that in [48 years of Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)) there is no such interpreter (or I did not find one)
